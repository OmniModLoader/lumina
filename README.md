# Lumina

Lumina is [OmniMC](https://omnimc.org)'s solution to mapping creation. 

## What is in Lumina.

Lumina has a custom-built file type in order to keep mappings file size down and to help with lazily loading the mapping data.
This file type is called MCMAP (Minecraft Mapping.) All of our mappings are in this file type.

**(MMP IS NOT INCLUDED YET, THIS IS JUST OUR IDEA OF AN IMPLEMENTATION!!)**

We also include something called MMP (Minecraft Mapping Patch.) 
It functions as a way for mods (or any program) to add patches to any mappings.
We include this so you can dynamically modify names of methods, classes, fields and even parameters if you don't like the given names.

## How to work with Lumina

Documentation will be included in future versions.
